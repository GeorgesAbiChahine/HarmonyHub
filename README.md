# HarmonyHub: Adaptive, Accessible Music Practice

Open-source toolkit for generating **inclusive, pedagogically sound music exercises** from structured prompts. HarmonyHub pairs rule-based + AI-assisted generation with accessibility-first outputs (MIDI/MP3/JSON/notation variants) to support teachers, students, and researchers.

> Built in the open with INCF / Google Summer of Code 2025 roots—now welcoming contributors, classrooms, and research partners.

## Why HarmonyHub
Traditional method books assume a “standard” learner. HarmonyHub flips that by generating practice materials that adapt to the learner: key, level, time signature, focus, and accessibility needs. Outputs can be visual, auditory, or multi-sensory—ready for classrooms, community music programs, or individual study.

## Features at a Glance
- 🎛️ Promptable exercise generation (instrument, level, key, time signature, focus).
- 🎼 Multi-format outputs: JSON, MIDI, MP3; visualizations via piano roll. (MusicXML and adapted notation pathways in progress.)
- ♿ Accessibility-first: enlarged/colored notation plans, Braille-friendly melodic export (simple melodies), and OSC/MIDI hooks for haptics.
- 🧠 Pedagogical controls: rhythmic complexity, practice focus, tempo, measure length.
- 🧰 Self-contained CLI plus modular Python library for research and integrations.

## Get Started
Prereqs: Python 3.10+ recommended; `fluidsynth` optional but improves audio quality.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional: ensure fluidsynth is available for rich soundfonts
```

### Smoke test
```bash
python cli.py generate --instrument Trumpet --level Intermediate --key "C Major" --time-signature "4/4" --measures 4 --output-format all
```
Outputs are saved under `./output` (JSON, MIDI, MP3, visualization PNG when `--output-format all`).

## CLI Usage
- Generate exercise
```bash
python cli.py generate --instrument Piano --level Beginner --key "G Major" --time-signature "3/4" --measures 8 --tempo 72 --output-format all
```
- Metronome
```bash
python cli.py metronome --tempo 60 --time-signature "4/4" --measures 4
```
- Convert saved JSON to MIDI/MP3
```bash
python cli.py convert --input-file exercise.json --output-format mp3 --instrument Flute
```
- Discover options
```bash
python cli.py info
```

## Contribute
We welcome open-source contributors, students, and mentors.
- **Issues & Ideas:** Start a GitHub issue for bugs, features, or accessibility requests.
- **Pull Requests:** Add tests (`python -m unittest discover tests`) and keep functions documented.
- **Google Summer of Code (INCF):** Use this repo as the working codebase; propose features such as adapted notation exports, new instruments, or UI/UX prototypes.
- **Good first tasks:**
  - Improve MusicXML/notation export coverage.
  - Expand soundfont set and caching.
  - Add accessibility fixtures (color/size schemas) to visualization.
  - Write sample prompts + tutorials for common classroom needs.
- **Open challenge:** Build a browser renderer that converts generated JSON exercises into Western staff notation. See `docs/notation-challenge.md`.

## Academic & Classroom Use
- **Research:** The framework can act as a controllable stimulus generator for studies in music learning, HCI, or accessibility. Cite the project and include prompt + parameter logs for reproducibility.
- **Teaching:** Use the CLI to generate leveled drills, rhythm patterns, or call/response material. Export MIDI/MP3 for LMS uploads or play-alongs.
- **Case studies:** Phase 2 focuses on participatory design with L’Arche London; we’re eager to partner on parallel studies—open an issue to discuss protocols and ethics.

## Roadmap (2025–2026)
- Phase 1: Robust generative backend, multiple representations, automated tests and docs.
- Phase 2: Co-designed interfaces in community settings; accessibility feature hardening (Braille, haptics, enlarged/colored notation presets).
- Stretch: Web service wrapper + auth, educator-facing prompt templates, dataset of vetted exercises.

## Community Principles
- Accessibility and inclusion first; avoid ableist defaults.
- Transparent pedagogy: generated outputs must be explainable and editable by teachers.
- Collaboration over competition: academic + open-source contributions are equally valued.
- Ethical AI use: no hidden data collection; prioritize user consent and agency.
